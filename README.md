# Notes (Clone)
Notes is an iOS 9 app built in Swift 2. It is a mockup of the preloaded Notes app. Users can add notes, search for them, edit them, and delete them. The app uses data persistence using NSCoding so your notes list is always saved on the device even when the app is updated. 


# To Run

1) Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/filzamazahir/Notes_iOS.git
```

2) Connect your iOS device to your Mac (make sure to have XCode installed). Open the NotesClone.xcode proj file and run it using Command+R or Product -> Run
